# Launcher

Another Game Launcher I guess...

## Overview

A game launcher using Flutter: frontend, Rust: backend, Lua: scripts, Tauri: Renderer. For anyone wanting to contribute, I'm probably not going to be merging branches if its so far in the future since... yeah, I'll probably forget about this project in like, a month. But still feel free to contribute things to this repo.


### Windows Installation

I'm not going to write an installation while this app still doesn't work lol.
